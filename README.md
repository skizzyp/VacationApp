Application title: Scott's Vacation App
This project creates a mobile application used to manage vacations as well as excursions associated with those vacations.
Additionally the application allows users to share details of their excursions with their contacts and set notifications to 
display at the start or end of a vacation and the time of an excursion.

Directions:
Once the application has been started, click "Enter" to get to the vacation screen. Using the menu item "Add sample data", create
a sample vacation.
Once in the vacation details screen, click "add excursions".  Enter a title and date for the excursion, if the date is outside the 
vacation dates the application will not allow the user to save the excursion. Once a proper date has been entered, as well as a note,
selecting the "share" option will allow excursion information to be shared with contacts.
Save an excursion and navigate back to the vacation detail screen.  Attempting to delete a vacation with excursions will be prevented and
a Toast notification will be shown.  
On the vacation details screen the notify options will set notifications for the start date and end date. Similarly the notify option on
the excursions page will set a notification for the excursion date.
Switching to landscape on any screen will reflect an adjusted layout ensuring the application is still usable in any orientation.
